# ProXPL v1.2.0: The "Pillars of Power" Release

**Release Date:** January 20, 2026

We are thrilled to announce **ProXPL v1.2.0**, a landmark release that defines the soul of the language. This update introduces the frontend implementation for our **10 Operational Pillars**, transforming ProXPL from a standard language into a next-generation power tool for intent-oriented, self-healing, and intrinsically secure computing.

## 🌟 Highlights

### The 10 Operational Pillars
We have implemented the syntax and frontend logic (Lexer, Parser, AST, Type Checker) for:

1.  **Intent-Oriented Programming**: Define *what* you want, not just *how* to do it with `intent` and `resolver`.
2.  **Context-Aware Polymorphism**: Functions that adapt to their environment using `context`, `layer`, and `activate`.
3.  **Autonomic Self-Healing (ASR)**: Build software that fixes itself with `resilient` blocks and `recovery` strategies.
4.  **Intrinsic Security**: Values are `tainted` by default. Safety is enforced by the compiler, requiring explicit `sanitize()` calls.
5.  **Chrono-Native Logic**: Variables that understand time, with `temporal` types and `decay after` properties.
6.  **Event-Driven Concurrency**: Seamlessly integrated with our ASR and distributed systems.
7.  **AI-Native Integration**: First-class support for AI models with `model`, `train`, and `predict` keywords.
8.  **Quantum-Ready Syntax**: Preparing for the future with `quantum` blocks and `qubit` types.
9.  **Hardware-Accelerated Math**: Native `gpu`, `tensor`, and `matrix` types for high-performance computing.
10. **Zero-Trust Security**: Built-in `verify`, `identity`, and encryption primitives.

### Critical Fixes
- **Security Logic**: Resolved type-checking errors where tainted values were not properly propagating or allowing sanitization.
- **Build Stability**: Fixed persistent CI/CD failures related to dependency lock files and build script paths.
- **Compiler Robustness**: Patched parser compilation errors to ensure smoother builds on all platforms.
