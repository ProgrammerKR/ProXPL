# Contributing to ProXPL

We love your input! We want to make contributing to ProXPL as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`python tests/test_specs.py`).
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style (variable naming, comments).
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/ProgrammerKR/ProXPL/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Coding Style

- Use **4 spaces** for indentation.
- Keep functions small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Comment complex logic.
- Follow PEP8 for Python code (except line length where it hurts readability).
